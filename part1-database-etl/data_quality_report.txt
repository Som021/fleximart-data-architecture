1. INTRODUCTION

---

This Data Quality Report documents the issues identified in the raw
FlexiMart datasets and the corrective actions applied during the
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

The objective of this phase was to ensure that all data loaded into the
MySQL database is accurate, consistent, reliable, and free from
referential integrity issues.

2. DATASETS REVIEWED

---

## Dataset Name            Description

customers_raw.csv       Customer personal and registration data
products_raw.csv        Product catalog information
sales_raw.csv           Sales transactions and order details

3. DATA QUALITY ISSUES AND FIXES

---

## CUSTOMERS DATA

Issues Identified:

* Duplicate customer records
* Same email appearing multiple times
* Inconsistent phone number formats
* Phone numbers with spaces, dashes, or missing country code
* Missing email addresses
* Multiple date formats such as:
  15/04/2023, 2023-04-15, 04-15-2023

Actions Taken:
Issue                        Fix Applied
----------------------------------------

Duplicate customers          Removed duplicates using email
Phone inconsistency          Standardized to +91-XXXXXXXXXX
Missing email                Rows removed
Date format mismatch         Converted using pandas to_datetime()

Result:

* Cleaned and deduplicated customer records
* Only valid customer records loaded into the database

---

## PRODUCTS DATA

Issues Identified:

* Missing product prices
* Inconsistent category naming
  (electronics, Electronics, ELECTRONICS)
* Missing stock quantities
* Duplicate product IDs

Actions Taken:
Issue                        Fix Applied
----------------------------------------

Missing price                Replaced with median price
Category inconsistency       Capitalized category values
Missing stock quantity       Set stock to 0
Duplicate products           Retained unique product IDs

Result:

* Uniform and standardized product catalog
* Safe default values for pricing and inventory

---

## SALES DATA

Issues Identified:

* Duplicate sales transactions
* Missing customer or product references
* Multiple order date formats
* Invalid foreign key references

Actions Taken:
Issue                        Fix Applied
----------------------------------------

Duplicate sales              Removed duplicate rows
Missing customer/product     Skipped invalid records
Date inconsistency           Converted to standard DATE format
Foreign key violations       Verified existence before insert

Result:

* Only valid sales records loaded
* No foreign key constraint violations occurred

4. DATA QUALITY SUMMARY

---

## Dataset        Raw Rows           Cleaned Rows

Customers      Initial count      Deduplicated count
Products       Initial count      Cleaned count
Sales          Initial count      Valid transactions

All cleaned datasets were successfully loaded into the MySQL database.

---

5. CONCLUSION

---

The ETL process significantly improved data quality by eliminating
duplicates, resolving inconsistencies, standardizing formats, and
removing invalid references.

The FlexiMart dataset is now analytics-ready, production-safe, and
suitable for reporting and business intelligence use cases.
